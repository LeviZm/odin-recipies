    <h1>Stuffed Peppers</h1>
    <img src="../images/stuffed-peppers.jpg" alt="Image of stuffed peppers" height="450" width="450">
    <p>Classic Stuffed Peppers were one of the first “grown up” dinners I learned to cook.
        Of that early repertoire, they remain the recipe I cook most, because with rice,
        ground beef, cheese, and veggies, they are an all-in-one meal! Plus, they’re easy
        to make AND absolutely delicious.
